## Tasks 

### 1. **Understand OSI & TCP/IP Models**
- Learn about the OSI and TCP/IP models, including their layers and purposes.
- **Task:** Write examples of how each layer applies to real-world scenarios (e.g., HTTP at the Application Layer, TCP at the Transport Layer).

### For each layer, think of a real-world application scenario. For example:
1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)** üåê
This layer provides network services directly to applications. It allows users to interact with the network through software.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you visit a website (e.g., Google), your web browser uses the HTTP or HTTPS protocol to send a request to the web server. 
The server then responds by sending the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets back to the browser to display the web page.
**Example:** You enter https://www.google.com in your browser. 
The HTTP protocol works at the Application Layer to send the request and receive the web page from the server.

**2. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)** üé®
The Presentation Layer ensures that the data sent between applications is in a format that both the sender and receiver can understand.
It handles encryption, decryption, data compression, and format translation.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you log in to your bank's website, the data you send (your username and password) is encrypted using SSL/TLS before being transmitted
over the internet. This ensures secure communication.
**Example:** When you access https://www.bank.com, your connection is secured with TLS, 
encrypting your sensitive data at the Presentation Layer before it‚Äôs transmitted.

**3. Session Layer (Layer 5)** üîÑ
The Session Layer manages sessions between applications. It establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you're in a video conference call (e.g., on Zoom), the Session Layer is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
the communication session between your computer and the Zoom server. 
It ensures that the session stays alive as long as necessary.
**Example:** When you join a Zoom meeting, the session is initiated and maintained by the Session Layer, allowing you to communicate 
in real-time.

**4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)** üöö
The Transport Layer is responsible for delivering data reliably or unreliably, depending on the protocol used (e.g., TCP or UDP). 
TCP ensures that data is delivered without errors, while UDP focuses on speed.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you send an email using SMTP, the Transport Layer ensures the message is reliably transferred from your email client to 
the email server using TCP. The TCP protocol ensures all data packets are correctly sequenced and no data is lost.
**Example:** Sending an email via SMTP relies on TCP at the Transport Layer to guarantee that the entire message is delivered in 
the correct order.

**5. Network Layer (Layer 3)** üõ£Ô∏è
The Network Layer determines the best physical path for data to travel from the sender to the receiver. It handles routing through 
IP addresses.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you send a message on WhatsApp to a friend, your message travels over the internet via multiple routers. The Network Layer's 
IP protocol ensures that the message is routed correctly to your friend's device.
**Example:** When you send a WhatsApp message, the IP address at the Network Layer ensures that the message travels through 
the best available path to your friend's device.

**6. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** üì°
The Data Link Layer is responsible for node-to-node communication and managing the transfer of data frames between devices on the 
same network. It also handles error detection.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you're connected to a Wi-Fi network, the Data Link Layer manages the communication between your device and the Wi-Fi router. 
The router uses the Ethernet protocol to send and receive data frames within the local network.
**Example**: When you're browsing the internet using Wi-Fi, your device uses the Ethernet protocol at the Data Link Layer to exchange 
data with the Wi-Fi router.

**7. Physical Layer (Layer 1)** üîå
The Physical Layer involves the actual transmission of raw bits (0s and 1s) over a physical medium, such as cables or wireless signals.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you plug an Ethernet cable into your computer to connect to the internet, the Physical Layer is responsible for transmitting the 
electrical signals over the cable. It handles the actual physical connection.
**Example:** Your computer's Ethernet port and cable work at the Physical Layer to transmit binary data as electrical signals between 
your device and the router.

###TCP/IP Model: Real-World Scenarios and Examples

**1. Application Layer (Combines Layers 5, 6, 7 of OSI)** üåç
This layer combines the functionality of OSI‚Äôs Application, Presentation, and Session layers. It handles all high-level protocols 
like HTTP, SMTP, and FTP.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you download a file from an FTP server, the FTP protocol at the Application Layer manages the transfer.
**Example:** FTP is used to transfer large files between a client and server at the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model.

**2. Transport Layer (Corresponds to Layer 4 of OSI)** üöõ
The Transport Layer ensures reliable or unreliable delivery of data, just like in the OSI model. TCP is used for reliable delivery, 
while UDP is used for faster, less reliable transmission.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you stream a live sports event on YouTube, UDP is used for video data transmission. The focus here is on speed, so minor data 
loss is acceptable.
**Example:** Watching a live stream on YouTube uses UDP at the Transport Layer, prioritizing speed over perfect data delivery.

**3. Internet Layer (Corresponds to Layer 3 of OSI)** üåê
The Internet Layer handles routing and forwarding of packets across networks using the IP protocol.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you're sending an email to someone across the world, the Internet Layer's IP protocol ensures the email is routed through various 
networks until it reaches its destination.
**Example:** Sending an email across multiple networks uses IP at the Internet Layer to route the message from one location to another.

**4. Network Access Layer (Combines Layers 1 and 2 of OSI)** üì°üîß
This layer handles the physical transmission of data over network hardware, including both the Data Link and Physical layers of the OSI 
model.
**Real-World Scenario:**
When you're connected to the internet through your home Wi-Fi network, the Network Access Layer manages how the data is physically 
sent between your device and the router.
**Example:** Connecting your laptop to a Wi-Fi network uses the Ethernet protocol at the Network Access Layer to transmit data over the wireless signal.
