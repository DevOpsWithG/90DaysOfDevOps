     cat /etc/passwd | grep devops
     devops_user:x:1003:1003::/home/devops_user:/bin/bash
     ```
  
  3. Similarly creating and verifyifing  user `tester` and `developer`
     ```
     tester:x:1004:1004::/home/tester:/bin/bash
     developer:x:1005:1005::/home/developer:/bin/bash
     ```
  
  4. Creating a group `devops_team` and verifying it
     ```
     sudo groupadd devops_team
     cat /etc/group | grep devops_team
     devops_team:x:1006:
     ```
  
  5. Adding multiple user to devops_team and verifying it
     ```
     sudo gpasswd -M devops_user,tester devops_team
     cat /etc/group | grep tester
     devops_team:x:1006:devops_user,tester
     ```
  
  6. Removing user devops_user from group tester

     sudo gpasswd -d devops_user tester
     Removing user devops_user from group tester

  9. Updating password for devops_user
      ```
      ubuntu@ip-172-31-45-204:~$ sudo passwd devops_user
